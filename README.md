## About this repository:

This is the python-library you can use for your project to build `*`.ecmb - files without caring about the internals of the file-format.
You can't do anything wrong with this, coz if you do a mistake (eg. passing a boolean to set_summary()) an ecmbException will be raised. After the creation the file will be automatic validated.

# Using the library

### Installation
- download and install Python3 (>=3.11) [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- open the console and then
    - run `pip install ecmblib`
 
### Trying out examples
- download and install Python3 (>=3.11) [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- download and install Git [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)Â´
- open the git-console and then
    - clone this repositiory `git clone git@github.com:metacreature/ecmblib_python.git`
    - go to the project-folder `cd ecmblib_python/`
    - run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - go to the example-folder `cd examples/advanced_book/`
    - run `python advanced_book.py`
The examples are working even if you didn't install the library via pip, but coz of the relative import type-hinting is not working.
If you want to use type-hinting you have to install the library first and then change the import of ecmblib at the top of the examples.
