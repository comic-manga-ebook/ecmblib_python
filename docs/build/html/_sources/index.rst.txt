Welcome to ecmblib's documentation!
===================================

"ecmblib" is the python-library you can use for your project to build `*`.ecmb - files without caring about the internals of the file-format.
You can't do anything wrong with this, coz if you do a mistake (eg. passing a boolean to set_summary()) an ecmbException will be raised. 
After the creation the file will be automatic validated.
